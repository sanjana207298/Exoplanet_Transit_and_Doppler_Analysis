# Exoplanet_Transit_and_Doppler_Analysis
This project focuses on the analysis of exoplanets using the transit and Doppler methods. The transit method measures the change in the light curve of a star when a planet transits across it, while the radial-velocity method calculates the velocities of the star and planet in order to determine the system's momentum.

A model was made of the change in the light curve of a star when a planet transits across it. The amount of the star covered by the planet when the latter partially covers the former was figured out.

As the planet orbits the star, the total momentum of the system remains constant, and the velocities of the star and the planet with respect to an external observer must be such that this condition is met. The radial velocity of the star as seen from the outside was calculated by a program, for a given star-planet pair at a certain orientation. The velocities were transformed to equivalent Doppler shifts, which are the observable quantities.

A way to determine as much as possible about the planet and the star from transit and Doppler observations was figured out.

Real exoplanet data for a well-studied system was obtained, and the method was tested to see if the findings could be reproduced.
