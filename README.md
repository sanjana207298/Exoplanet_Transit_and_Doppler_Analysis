# Exoplanet_Transit_and_Doppler_Analysis
This project focuses on the analysis of exoplanets using the transit and Doppler methods. The transit method measures the change in the light curve of a star when a planet transits across it, while the radial-velocity method calculates the velocities of the star and planet in order to determine the system's momentum.
